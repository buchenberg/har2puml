## Features

### UML Sequence Diagrams from Har

The sequence diagram can be used represent the communication flow between the User Agent (the browser client) and the various services. The diagram is generated by parsing the Har JSON. The diagram may be augmented by adding metadata to the Har file using the editor and clicking "Generate" again. The following sections describe the JSON elements and how they are used .

#### Participants

The first participant is always named 'User Agent'. All other participant names are derived from the path string in the entries[*]request.url. The Optional entries[]['x-service-name'] metadata extension will be used if it exists. A participant will be created for each entry where the names are different. If you have several entries for the same service you may give each the same x-service-name and they will combine to one participant.
